# Assignment 3
InstaFake like/heart button + increment like numbers

**updateHeart = () function**
- Using prevState to toggle like image of IG heart
- Toggling the image back and forth using two different links
- Had to replace the word like with image of clear heart and used position:relative to stack image
- Can't seem to get it to increment/decrement

Will need assistance with increment/decrement. I feel I'm close, but can't seem to connect it.
